## The String Type
The `String` type is a *complex data type*. This type manages data allocated on the heap and as such is able to store an arbitrary amount of text that is unknown at compile time.

You can create a `String` from a string literal using the `from` method:
```Rust
let s = String::from("hello");
```

The double colon `::` operator allows us to namespace the function under the `String` type.

The string can be mutated as follows:
```Rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");

s.push_str(", world!"); // push_str() appends a literal to a String
```
